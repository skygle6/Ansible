Assert vs Block:
===============

The `assert` module and the `block` structure in Ansible serve different purposes.

1. **`assert` module:**

   The `assert` module is used to verify or assert conditions during playbook execution. It allows you to perform checks and enforce specific conditions. If the condition specified in the `assert` module fails, the playbook execution will stop and an error message will be displayed. The `assert` module is typically used within a task to validate certain assumptions or requirements.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Assert disk space
     assert:
       that: disk_space_output.stdout_lines[1] | int <= 80
       fail_msg: "Disk space exceeds 80%!"
       success_msg: "Disk space is within limits."
   ```

   In the above example, the `assert` module checks if the disk space usage is less than or equal to 80%. If the condition fails, the playbook execution will stop.

2. **`block` structure:**

   The `block` structure is used to group a set of tasks together. It provides a way to logically group tasks and handle errors more efficiently. If any task within the `block` fails, the error is caught, and you can define specific error handling using the `rescue` or `always` sections. The `block` structure is helpful in scenarios where you want to perform multiple tasks and handle exceptions collectively.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   - name: Block example
     block:
       - name: Task 1
         # Task 1 details...
       - name: Task 2
         # Task 2 details...
     rescue:
       - name: Handle error
         # Error handling task...
     always:
       - name: Cleanup
         # Cleanup task...
   ```

   In the above example, the `block` structure includes two tasks (`Task 1` and `Task 2`). If any task within the `block` fails, the execution moves to the `rescue` section where you can define error handling tasks. The `always` section is executed regardless of whether an error occurs or not and is commonly used for cleanup tasks.

To summarize, the `assert` module is used to validate conditions within a task, whereas the `block` structure is used to group tasks and handle errors collectively. They serve different purposes but can be used together in a playbook to ensure proper validations and error handling.
