In Ansible, you can use conditional statements to control the flow of your playbook based on certain conditions. Conditional statements allow you to perform different tasks or execute specific blocks of code based on the values of variables, facts, or other conditions.

Ansible supports various conditional statements, including the following:

1. **When Statement:** The `when` statement allows you to specify a condition that determines whether a task should be executed or skipped. It uses Jinja2 templating syntax to evaluate the condition. Here's an example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook with When Statement
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Install package on Ubuntu
         apt:
           name: package-name
           state: present
         when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
   ```

   In this example, the `apt` task will be executed only on Ubuntu hosts because the `when` condition checks if the `ansible_distribution` fact is equal to "Ubuntu".

2. **Block Statement:** The `block` statement allows you to group a set of tasks together and apply a common condition to the entire block. If the condition is not met, the entire block is skipped. Here's an example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook with Block Statement
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Update apt cache
         apt:
           update_cache: yes

       - block:
           - name: Install package on Debian
             apt:
               name: package-name
               state: present

           - name: Restart service
             service:
               name: service-name
               state: restarted
         when: ansible_distribution == "Debian"
   ```

   In this example, the entire block of tasks will be executed only on Debian hosts because the `when` condition is evaluated before the block.

3. **Conditional Expressions:** Ansible also supports conditional expressions, which allow you to define more complex conditions using logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. Here's an example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook with Conditional Expressions
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Install package if condition is met
         apt:
           name: package-name
           state: present
         when: (ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" or ansible_distribution == "Debian") and ansible_architecture == "x86_64"
   ```

   In this example, the `apt` task will be executed on hosts where the distribution is either "Ubuntu" or "Debian" and the architecture is "x86_64".

These are just a few examples of how conditional statements can be used in Ansible playbooks. Conditional statements provide flexibility and allow you to control the execution of tasks based on specific conditions, making your automation more dynamic and adaptable.


**more**

In Ansible, the `changed_when` and `failed_when` parameters are used to control the interpretation of task results and determine when a task should be considered "changed" or "failed". They provide fine-grained control over the success/failure status and the display of task results in the playbook output.

1. **changed_when:** The `changed_when` parameter is used to override the default behavior of determining whether a task has made changes on the target hosts. By default, Ansible considers a task as "changed" if it modifies the system in any way. However, you can use the `changed_when` parameter to specify a custom condition that determines when a task should be considered "changed". Here's an example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook with changed_when
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Execute a command
         command: echo "Hello, Ansible!"
         changed_when: false
   ```

   In this example, the `command` task will always be considered as "changed" in the playbook output, regardless of whether it actually makes any changes on the system. By setting `changed_when` to `false`, you override the default behavior and indicate that the task should not be considered "changed" even if it runs successfully.

2. **failed_when:** The `failed_when` parameter is used to define a custom condition that determines when a task should be considered "failed". By default, a task is considered "failed" if its return code indicates failure (non-zero). However, you can use the `failed_when` parameter to specify a different condition for failure. Here's an example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook with failed_when
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Execute a command and ignore failures
         command: some_command
         failed_when: false
   ```

   In this example, the `command` task will not be considered "failed" in the playbook output, regardless of its return code. By setting `failed_when` to `false`, you indicate that the task should not be considered "failed" even if it returns a non-zero exit code.

Both `changed_when` and `failed_when` accept Jinja2 expressions that allow you to define complex conditions based on variables, facts, or other factors in your playbook.

By using `changed_when` and `failed_when`, you can customize the interpretation of task results and control how Ansible determines success or failure. These parameters provide flexibility and allow you to fine-tune the behavior and reporting of your playbook tasks.

**ignore_errors**

In Ansible, you can use the `ignore_errors` parameter to ignore errors that occur during the execution of tasks. When `ignore_errors` is set to `yes` or `true`, Ansible will continue executing the playbook even if a task fails, and it will not consider the failure as a playbook failure.

Here's an example of how to use the `ignore_errors` parameter:

```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with ignore_errors
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Execute a command and ignore errors
      command: some_command
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Another task
      debug:
        msg: "This task will be executed even if the previous task fails"
```

In this example, the `ignore_errors` parameter is set to `yes` for the `command` task. If the `some_command` task fails, Ansible will continue executing the playbook and move on to the next task without considering the failure as a playbook failure.

By using `ignore_errors`, you can control how Ansible handles task failures and decide whether to continue executing the playbook or stop the execution. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to perform error handling or execute certain tasks regardless of the outcome of previous tasks. However, it's important to be cautious when using `ignore_errors` as it may lead to unexpected behavior or issues in your playbook execution.
