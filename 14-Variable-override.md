When using roles in Ansible, you can override variables defined within roles by providing new values in the playbook or in the inventory. Here are a few ways to override variables in roles:

1. **Playbook Variable Overrides:** You can override role variables directly in the playbook by specifying new values using the `vars` section. For example:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook
     hosts: all
     roles:
       - my_role
     vars:
       my_role_variable: new_value
   ```

   In this example, the `my_role_variable` defined within the `my_role` role will be overridden with the value `new_value`.

2. **Inventory Variable Overrides:** If you have defined variables in your inventory, you can override role variables by assigning new values in the inventory file. For example:

   ```ini
   [my_hosts]
   host1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 my_role_variable=new_value
   ```

   In this case, the `my_role_variable` defined within the `my_role` role will be overridden with the value `new_value` specifically for the `host1` host.

3. **Extra Variables:** You can pass variables to Ansible at runtime using the `--extra-vars` option. For example:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml --extra-vars "my_role_variable=new_value"
   ```

   This will override the `my_role_variable` with the value `new_value` for the execution of the playbook.

4. **Variable Precedence:** Ansible follows a specific order of precedence when resolving variable values. Variables defined in a role have a lower precedence compared to variables defined in playbooks, inventory, or passed as extra variables. Therefore, variables defined at a higher precedence level will override variables defined within roles.

   The order of precedence, from highest to lowest, is:
   - Command-line extra variables (`--extra-vars`)
   - Playbook variables (within the `vars` section)
   - Role variables (within the role's `vars` directory or in `vars/main.yml`)
   - Inventory variables
   - Fact variables

By using these techniques, you can easily override role variables at different levels in Ansible, allowing for flexibility and customization based on specific requirements or environments.

**Over ride using another file**

Yes, you can override variables in roles by using another variable file. Ansible allows you to include additional variable files that override the default values defined within a role. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a separate variable file with the desired variable values. For example, let's call it `override_vars.yml`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   my_role_variable: new_value
   ```

2. In your playbook, include the role and specify the path to the override variable file using the `vars_files` directive:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Example Playbook
     hosts: all
     roles:
       - { role: my_role, vars_files: ['path/to/override_vars.yml'] }
   ```

   In this example, the role `my_role` will be executed, and the variable values defined in `override_vars.yml` will override the default values within the role.

   Note: You can specify multiple variable files by providing a list of file paths within the `vars_files` directive.

By using an additional variable file, you can easily override role variables without modifying the role itself. This approach allows for better separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage and maintain variable values specific to different environments or use cases.
