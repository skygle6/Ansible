Ansible Templates:

In Ansible, the `template` module is used to render template files and create configuration files on managed hosts. It allows you to dynamically generate files by substituting variables and expressions within the template.

To use the `template` module, follow these steps:

1. Create a template file: Start by creating a template file using a text editor. This file will contain placeholders for variables or expressions that will be replaced during the rendering process. Template files typically have the `.j2` extension to indicate they are Jinja2 templates.

   Here's an example template file named `config.j2`:

   ```jinja2
   # Configuration File

   # Server Address
   server_address = {{ server_address }}

   # Port Number
   port = {{ port }}
   ```

2. Create an Ansible playbook: Create an Ansible playbook that includes a task using the `template` module. This task will specify the source template file and the destination file path where the rendered template will be saved on the managed hosts.

   Here's an example playbook named `template_example.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - name: Render template
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Render configuration file
         template:
           src: config.j2
           dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf
   ```

3. Provide variable values: You can provide the values for the variables used in the template in several ways. One common approach is to define the variables in an inventory file or group_vars file. Alternatively, you can pass the variable values as extra variables using the `-e` flag when running the playbook.

   For example, in an inventory file named `inventory.ini`:

   ```ini
   [servers]
   server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10

   [servers:vars]
   server_address=192.168.1.10
   port=8080
   ```

4. Run the playbook: Execute the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command and specify the inventory file, playbook file, and any required options or variables.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini template_example.yml
   ```

   This will render the template file and create the configuration file `/etc/myapp/config.conf` on the managed hosts using the provided variable values.

The `template` module allows you to create dynamic configuration files tailored to each host by substituting variables or expressions. This approach simplifies managing and deploying configurations across multiple hosts with varying settings.

Note: Ensure that the Jinja2 templating syntax within the template file is correct and matches the variable names used in your playbook or inventory files.

Certainly! Here are two examples of passing variables from a variable file to Ansible templates:

1. Using a variables file:
   Let's say you have a variables file named `vars.yml` that contains the values for the variables used in your template. The file can be structured like this:

   ```yaml
   server_address: 192.168.1.10
   port: 8080
   ```

   In your playbook, you can include the variables file and reference the variables within the template task:

   ```yaml
   - name: Render template
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Include variables file
         include_vars:
           file: vars.yml

       - name: Render configuration file
         template:
           src: config.j2
           dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf
   ```

   In this example, the `include_vars` task is used to load the variables from `vars.yml`. The subsequent `template` task can then access the variable values defined in the file.

2. Using extra variables:
   You can also pass variables directly through the command line using the `-e` option when running the playbook. This method is useful when you want to override or provide variable values dynamically during playbook execution.

   For example, you can pass the variable values as extra variables when running the playbook:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini template_example.yml -e "server_address=192.168.1.10" -e "port=8080"
   ```

   In this case, the variable values for `server_address` and `port` are provided as extra variables through the command line. The `template` task in the playbook can access these values as if they were defined in a variables file or inventory.

Both methods allow you to pass variable values to your Ansible templates, whether through a separate variables file or as extra variables via the command line. Choose the approach that best suits your requirements and deployment workflow.
